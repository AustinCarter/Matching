High Level: Build a React web app that retrieves matches for the current logged in member.

ex. A member joins as Brian, and requests a match, and that profile is displayed onto the screen.
	Brian can end call
	Brian can start the next match
	Brianâ€™s match should be able to log in, and see Brian on the screen.

	Bonus:
	More Efficient Matching:
		Match users based on tags / criteria
	Database 
	Other features you think of

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Login
	-Create Profile
		- Check if it exists
		- Register to Database
	- Check credintials
		- Username/email
		- Hashed password
		------ 2fac?
	- Check if someone is currently in call with you, otherwise show Request match

Edit Profile/Add data
	- Name
	- Profile pic?
	- Matching Tags/prefs

Request match

Matching
	- Query for users
	- Calculate fitness/good matches
		-Matching algorithim?
		- Cuold be interesting to do an anti-match every n matches
	- Filter based on score
		- Filter tolerence should grow as matches depleted
	- Display match from potential pool
		- Could show tags/criteria that was matched on (depending on opaqueness of matching alg)

Show user on screen
	- PROVISIONARY:  just mutually display profiles when "in a call" 
	- Access Camera and mic
	- Process/encode audio and video data
		- *******I predict this will be the largest pain point out of everything*********

Someone ends call
	- Other user should see the request match screen
